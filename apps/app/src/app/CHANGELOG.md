# Changelog: Route Groups Refactoring

## Overview

This project has been refactored to use Next.js App Router route groups for better organization and maintainability.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Route Groups Structure

- **`(auth)` Route Group**: For authentication and authorization routes
- **`(dashboard)` Route Group**: For dashboard and application routes

### 2. Implemented Route Groups Layouts

- **`app/(auth)/layout.tsx`**: Authentication-specific layout with branding
- **`app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`**: Dashboard layout with sidebar and header

### 3. Organized Routes by Functionality

#### Auth Routes (`(auth)`)

- `/auth/login` - User login
- `/auth/register` - User registration
- `/auth/forgot-password` - Password recovery
- `/auth/reset-password` - Password reset
- `/auth/verify-email` - Email verification
- `/auth/otp` - One-time password
- `/auth/profile` - User profile
- `/auth/change-password` - Change password
- `/auth/email-change` - Change email
- `/auth/email-change-verification` - Email change verification
- `/auth/logout` - Logout
- `/auth/teams` - Teams management
- `/auth/get-teams` - Get teams API
- `/auth/get-profile` - Get profile API
- `/auth/get-users` - Get users API
- `/auth/create-user` - Create user API
- `/auth/update-user` - Update user API
- `/auth/delete-user` - Delete user API
- `/auth/create-role` - Create role API
- `/auth/update-role` - Update role API
- `/auth/delete-role` - Delete role API
- `/auth/generate-api-key` - Generate API key API
- `/auth/revoke-api-key` - Revoke API key API
- `/auth/list-api-keys` - List API keys API
- `/auth/list-roles` - List roles API
- `/auth/list-users` - List users API
- `/auth/list-teams` - List teams API
- `/auth/list-permissions` - List permissions API
- `/auth/list-sessions` - List sessions API

#### Dashboard Routes (`(dashboard)`)

- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard (redirects to overview)
- `/dashboard/overview` - Dashboard overview
- `/dashboard/auth` - Auth management (redirects to overview)
- `/dashboard/auth/overview` - Auth overview with stats
- `/dashboard/auth/users` - User management
- `/dashboard/auth/roles` - Role management
- `/dashboard/auth/api-keys` - API key management

### 4. Maintained Backward Compatibility

- Old routes in `app/dashboard/` are preserved
- All existing URLs continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 5. Implemented Features Architecture

- **`src/features/auth/`**: Authentication-related components, hooks, utils, and pages
- **`src/features/dashboard/`**: Dashboard-related components, hooks, utils, and pages
- **`src/features/monitors/`**: Monitoring-related features
- **`src/features/notifiers/`**: Notification-related features
- **`src/features/onboarding/`**: Onboarding-related features
- **`src/features/settings/`**: Settings-related features
- **`src/features/status-pages/`**: Status page-related features
- **`src/features/common/`**: Common/shared features

### 6. Created Skeleton Components

- All pages use Suspense boundaries
- Skeleton components provide consistent loading experiences
- Loading states are properly handled

### 7. Updated Import Structure

- UI components imported from `@synoro/ui`
- Feature components imported from `@/features/*`
- Proper separation of concerns

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Routes are grouped by functionality
2. **No URL Impact**: Route groups don't affect actual URLs
3. **Shared Layouts**: Each group has its own layout
4. **Team Collaboration**: Different teams can work on different groups
5. **Code Organization**: Related routes are kept together
6. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and scale
7. **Future-Proof**: Follows Next.js best practices

## File Structure

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use new route groups for new development
2. **Short-term**: Migrate existing pages to use new features structure
3. **Long-term**: Remove old dashboard structure when all pages are migrated

## Testing

- All routes work correctly
- Layouts are applied properly
- Navigation still works
- Loading states and error boundaries function
- Old routes still function

## Documentation
